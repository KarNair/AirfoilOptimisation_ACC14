# AirfoilOptimisation_ACC14

Airfoil optimisation on Cloud Requirements

Design and implement a cloud-based solution and service
for conducting experiments to assess the influence of the
angle of attack on the lift force.

As a minimal requirement, the system needs to work for a
statically configured input (apart from the meshes) and
there needs to be an assessment of the horizontally
scalability of your solution.
